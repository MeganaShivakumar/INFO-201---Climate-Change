The countries include a few countries that I thought would be interesting to look at, as well as two general categories: high-income countries and low-income countries. I specifically chose these two broader categories as I thought it would be interesting to see how the level of resources a country has impacts their CO2 emission levels."),

The data comes from a variety of different sources, including bp, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the Global Carbon Project to name a few. The data was collected to allow the general public to have access to key metrics relating to climate change and allow individuals to understand what is happening within our environment. Some of the possible limitations that arise from this data are that since many different sources were used to compile the dataset, there may be slight inconsistencies in how data was collected or how the measures relate to one another. This is an important aspect of the data to keep in mind when conducting analyses."), 
    p("Some of the key metrics that I found using this data are that this dataset includes 268 countries. The continent that produces the highest amount of production-based emissions of CO2 is Asia, while the continent with the lowest emissions is Africa. The country that has the highest primary energy consumption per capita is the United States Virgin Islands, a territory of the US with a population of about 100,000. The country with the lowest primary energy consumption per capita is Micronesia, a country near Oceania made of four islands, also with a population of about 100,000."), 
    p("This visualization shows that overall, CO2 production continues to increase in both high and low income countries. One detail that I thought was interesting was the slight increase and decrease that happened from year to year in some countries. I wonder what specific actions were taken that led to the decrease in CO2 production, and how that could be implemented on a larger scale. In addition, even smaller countries, with lower capital values and smaller populations, continue to increase their CO2 production rate at a similar rate to higher income countries, so I wonder if there is a way to decrease per capita usage in those types of areas.")
